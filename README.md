# NumerAI

Numerai is a unique, decentralized hedge fund that uses machine learning to generate and inform its investment decisions. The platform allows data scientists to submit their predictions based on Numerai's encrypted financial data. Numerai provides historical and current data sets to its users in the form of an encrypted file that is updated regularly. Participants then use programming languages like Python to create machine learning models to make predictions on this data with the oppurtunity to be compensated.

This is a personal project undertaken for the purpose of learning. The goal is to further grow my skills using data science libaries such as Pandas, TensorFlow, and SciPy.
